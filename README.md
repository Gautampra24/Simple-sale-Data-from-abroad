# 📊 Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I collaborated with stakeholders to understand their business questions and identify key insights required from the sales dataset. Based on these discussions, they wanted to analyze:

- **Sales**
- **Profit After Tax (PAT)**
- **Discount Amounts**
- **Shipping Charges**
- **Quantity Sold**
- **Product Quantity**

They were also interested in viewing data across multiple dimensions:

- **Yearly Trends**
- **Product Categories and Sub-Categories**
- **Geographic Segmentation (Country and State)**
- **Individual Products**
- **Top 10 Customers**
- **Overall Profitability**

Additionally, stakeholders wanted recommendations for:

- **Increasing company sales and profits**
- **Identifying countries or regions generating losses**
